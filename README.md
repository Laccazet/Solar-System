My main goal in this project was to better understand the mathematical functions of javascript and the logic of OOP.
That's why I made the movements of the planets not with css animations, but by calculating variables such as the sun's
position, the speed and orbit of the planet. And I added a simple mobile mode. I made the drawings of the planets myself.



The programs I use.
* Inkspace (For drawings)
* Visual Stuido Code
